## Description

*My Work Is Not Yet Done* is a pilgrimage simulator following the final days of the inquisitor Avery, the last remaining survivor of the Empire’s doomed excursionary efforts into the remote and unaccountable Reach. Tasked with tracking down the source of an inscrutable signal, she must navigate, survey and survive an eerie, ever-shifting landscape reclaimed by nature — and perhaps something stranger.

*My Work Is Not Yet Done* seeks to provide a unique and innovative take on the survival genre aimed at accurately reproducing the physical and psychological experience of being alone in the wilderness, resituating the player’s role within nature as an interloper rather than conquistador. The game is set in an expansive open world environment that eschews the genre tropes of cold weather survival for a dense, oppressively rainy and humid forest, seamlessly blending procedural generation with a variety of handcrafted locations to ensure a sense of constant disorientation even across repeat playthroughs. 

It is part of an ongoing series of works within a larger shared universe dedicated to examining questions of theological and cosmic horror: issues such as faith, weakness, devotion and loneliness — and the concomitant suffering contingent to such experiences.

## Features

* Combat-less exploration and survival gameplay, based on authentic bushcraft and land navigation techniques
* Deep, systemically-reactive survival simulation mechanics, focusing on both physical and psychic conditions
* A beautiful and expansive open world featuring real-time weather, atmospheric conditions, and day/night progression
* Dynamic environments that react to the player’s condition and behaviour
* A free-form unscripted narrative experience built around emergent gameplay and ambient lore

## About

Sutemi Productions is an American video game developer based in the New York metropolitan area. It derives its name from *sutemi waza*, a term in various Japanese martial arts that can be roughly translated as “arts of abandonment”: a series of techniques requiring the user to “abandon”, or sacrifice some part of their stance in order to create or exploit an opening in the opponent. The fundamental philosophy underlying all of the works produced under Sutemi Productions is that only through directly confronting, without insincerity or resentment, our deepest flaws and vulnerabilities can we begin to produce works that are honest to the best versions of what they – and we – can be.
