## Description

"First Love / Late Spring" is a brief meditation on mediocrity, fragility, and the quiet mounting frustration of trying to keep the conversation alive even though we all knew there was never anything there from the start.

Or something like that.

## History

"First Love / Late Spring" was made for Ludum Dare in about 30 to 40 hours, as a collaboration between myself, Jacob Williams, and Nathan Haddock. It was built in GameMaker Studio 2. It was our first major project together. 


## Technology

"First Love / Late Spring" was produced in GameMaker Studio 2. The [soundtrack](https://soundcloud.com/lateralis-music/baby-im-yours-breakbot-cover) was produced in Little Sound DJ.
