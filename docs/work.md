## Description

*My Work Is Not Yet Done* is a pilgrimage simulator following the final days of the inquisitor Avery, the last remaining survivor of the Empire’s doomed excursionary efforts into the remote and unaccountable Reach. Tasked with tracking down the source of an inscrutable signal, she must navigate, survey and survive an eerie, ever-shifting landscape reclaimed by nature — and something stranger.

*My Work Is Not Yet Done* seeks to provide a unique and innovative take on the survival genre aimed at accurately reproducing the physical and psychological experience of being alone and lost in the wilderness, and resituating the player’s role within nature as an interloper rather than conquistador. The game is set in an expansive open world environment that eschews the genre tropes of cold weather survival for a dense, oppressively rainy and humid forest, seamlessly blending procedural generation with handcrafted locations to ensure a sense of constant disorientation even across repeat playthroughs. It is part of an ongoing series of works within a larger shared universe dedicated to examining questions of theological and cosmic horror: issues such as faith, weakness, devotion and loneliness — and the concomitant suffering contingent to such narratives.

## Features

* Combat-less epxloration and survival gameplay, based on authentic bushcraft and land navigation techniques
* Deep, systemically-reactive survival simulation mechanics, emphasising both physical and psychological conditions
* A beautiful and expansive open world featuring real-time weather, atmospheric conditions, and day/night progression
* Dynamic environments that react to the player’s condition and behaviour
* Stark, striking 1-bit visuals, with an immersive HUD (and no hunger/thirst meters)
* A free-form unscripted narrative experience built around emergent gameplay and fragments of intricate lore

## History

The initial impetus for the game came from a rather comical moment when, confronted by the sudden and inconveniently imminent desire to evacuate my bowels in the middle of a walk, I was struck by the simultaneous realisation that very few works – games included – actually depict the act or urgency of defecation. Sure, there are a handful of titles that address the concept to some degree – Don’t Shit Your Pants being the most prominent I reckon, and actually a really quite interesting game in its own regards – but by and large it’s a(n understandably) taboo subject despite its ripe mechanical potential. 

Around the time (around May of 2019) I also happened to be playing through a number of survival games of varying degrees of quality and complexity… and despite waste management constituting such a prominent aspect of the survival (and outdoors in general) experience, virtually none of the games I was playing at the time dealt even cursorily with the need to somehow expel the biological byproducts of all the raw rabbit flesh and plant matter players’ bodies were processing at unnatural speeds. 
 
So basically, *My Work Is Not Yet Done* emerged out of my desire to address with serious earnesty the startling lack of games dealing with just how shitty it feels to actually shit in the woods. 

Once I finished animating and implementing said mechanic (which took all of perhaps one day), I began to realise just how much I actually wanted to work on a survival game at that point. I’ve alawys been a sucker for games with deep and needlessly involved simulation mechanics and the combination of rugged wilderness and said mechanical complexity in survival games has always attracted me in particular. My main gripe with virtually all survival games however has always been with the tail-end of the experience: once the initial challenge of survival is overcome, the player – limited to a system of interactions which basically boils down in most cases to destroying, breaking down and harvesting things for parts – runs up against an ever-growing scarcity of either challenge or interest (or in most cases, both). So-called “survival” games then become about base-building, conquistadorial expansion, or, in the cases of multiplayer titles, mindless PvP bloodshed. I wondered if it was possible to create a survival game that was truly about survival, that didn’t fall victim to the seemingly-inevitable trap of nihilistic post-scarcity violence. Nobody else was doing it, so after a while, I got tired of waiting, and just decided to do it myself.

## Influences

The most immediately obvious influence for *My Work Is Not Yet Done* is Jeff VanderMeer’s *Southern Reach* trilogy, and particularly *Annihilation*, whose premise – a small all-female expeditionary force is assembled by a government agency and sent into an uninhabitable semitropical region reclaimed by weird nature as part of what is ostensibly a research effort – is practically identical (or rather, I suppose it’s the other way around). Whereas *Annihilation*’s biologist largely sees the strangeness of Area X as a source of curiosity and even wonder, however, my goal with *My Work Is Not Yet Done* is to frame the wilderness more as a source of continuous unease and loneliness bordering on horror (not that these things are necessarily mutually exclusive in any manner). In particular, I drew extensively from *Authority*’s depiction of bureaucracy’s inability to even begin to address, let alone process the logic of nature and the organic, as well as the constant frustration and dissolution of identity encountered in the midst / face of impenetrable – literally or otherwise – wilderness. 

Other major points of influence in depicting the Reach include personal experiences while hiking/camping (mostly in the woods of New England), and several ongoing discussions with a friend regarding the intimate connection between savage violence, religious dissociation and wilderness, especially with regards to early colonial efforts in the Americas. These latter discussions were themselves largely influenced by Jennifer Kent’s *The Nightingale* (2019).

*The Blair Witch Project* (1999), *Blair Witch* (2016) and *The Banshee Chapter* (2013) were equally useful points of references for atmosphere and tone.

In regards to the mechanical design and implementation of the survival mechanics, I drew inspiration from Croteam’s *SCUM* (2019) and Hinterland’s *The Long Dark* (2017). The former is the only title that comes close in terms of the technical complexity of its survival systems (at least in regards to biomechanics and physiology), and provided a good feel for what kinds of complexity work well (and alternately, don’t). The latter’s pensive pace and tone gave me a good idea of how to design survival mechanics in a more positive and environmentally conscious (not to mention realistic) manner, where the player exists in tandem with and through the land rather than in control of it.

## About

Sutemi Productions is an independent digital collective based in the New York metropolitan area. It derives its name from *sutemi waza*, a term in various Japanese martial arts that can be roughly translated as “arts of abandonment”: a series of techniques requiring the user to “abandon”, or sacrifice some part of their stance in order to create or exploit an opening in the opponent. The fundamental philosophy underlying all of the works produced under Sutemi Productions is that only through directly confronting, without insincerity or resentment, our deepest flaws and vulnerabilities can we begin to produce works that are honest to the best versions of what they – and we – can be.
