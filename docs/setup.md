# Setup 

This is an ongoing documentation of my setup for work, including hardware and software. I've decided to start actively tracking this as a means of encouraging myself to take a more conscious approach to the tools I use and regularly rely upon. On the last day of each month I will conduct a survey of my setup assessing my usage for that month, and document any changes where necessary.

## Hardware 

My primary workstation is the Lenovo Y540 Legion, running the most recent version of Windows 10. It's connected to an ASUS VS239H-P 23" LED monitor, which I picked up from a friend since he no longer needed it, and essentially functions as a desktop alternative; I never move it except when cleaning. The main peripherals attached to it are an AUKEY 87-key mechanical keyboard and a VicTsing MM057 wireless mouse, both of which have serviced me for years across multiple computers. Audio output is handled through through the monitor, and input through a generic JOUNIVO USB mic from Amazon which my friends bought me out of frustration at the quality (or apparent lack thereof) of the laptop's built-in mic.

For remote work (ie, field recordings, hooked up to a projector, etc), I use an Acer Aspire E15, also running Windows 10. I don't use any fixed peripherals, and I generally keep every major I/O port sealed with a port cover when not in use. It's protected by a hard outer shell case, which I've modified with rubber moulding for additional padding and grip when transporting. I also use this computer as local storage for my Google Drive, using Google's Backup & Sync app to, well, backup and sync between the two. 

For general browsing and writing, I use an ASUS C213SA Chromebook with hybrid touchscreen support. It's a highly durable, cheap, and lightweight computer whose long battery life means that I can comfortably carry it everywhere on its own without the charger. It can be quickly locked and remotely wiped, and the small storage capacity encourages me to store things on Drive rather than locally, meaning no sensitive data is being stored on the machine itself. I use this as a very low-level device for commutes and the like (not that anybody, myself especially, is commuting much these days though, I suppose).

For audio recordings, I use a Zoom H4n Pro for general/outdoor work, and rent a Rode NT1 for dedicated foley. 

## Software

My general approach to software is to consolidate/reduce the programs I used so that I could install as little "extra" stuff as possible beyond the default starting apps. I got tired of having to keep a running list of several dozen apps which I had to then work through, top-to-bottom, every time I reset my computer or got a new one. I've now managed to reduce my list to under ten "essential" core programs.

For "coding"/development, I use GameMaker Studio 2 (1) as my primary and sole engine. I use GitHub Desktop (2) for backups, because I hate looking at the command line.

For text editing, I use Sublime Text 3 (3) for local documents; and prefer Markdown as my document format of choice. 

For image editing, GameMaker Studio 1.4's sprite editor (4) remains my personal choice in terms of ease of use, specific features, and familiarity. I keep a portable copy of Photoshop CS5 (5) around as well solely for its indexed colour mode, which allows me to rapidly apply dithering, saving me a lot of time. (As for why I chose PS over something like, say, GIMP, or CS5 over more more recent variants: CS5 is somehow surprisingly more lightweight than the alternatives, and is the last version as far as I'm aware that can be carried around on a flash drive, and which doesn't require me to install Adobe Creative Cloud.)

For audio editing, I use Audacity (6).

For communication, I use Discord (7). Although I used to insist on just using it in-browser, I finally gave in and downloaded it for voice/video calls. 

For everything else, from browsing to video editing to general media viewing, I use the respective built-in Windows 10 defaults, which I've found to be perfectly adequate for my needs. In-browser, I rely extensively on Google's ecosystem for file sharing and email and the like.
