## Description

*But For Now We Are Young* is an interactive coming-of-age series composed of twenty-two discontinuous vignettes spanning a decade in the life of an otherwise unremarkable human being.

Spanning an eclectic blend of genres and visual styles, *But For Now We Are Young* seeks to provide a unique and innovative take on the visual novel (VN) genre by presenting a realistic, nuanced examination of the traditional American coming-of-age narrative. Set in a small suburban town on the east coast, the game follows a sole unnamed character as he  disjointedly stumbles and drifts through a decade of boredom, elation, loneliness, and longing. What emerges is a relentless, desperate and perpetually frustrated (and occasionally frustrating) series of attempts at negotiating the fear of nostalgia for a youth that can no longer be relived and perhaps never existed in the first place; and the simultaneous anxieties of growing up, of forgetting, and of in time relinquishing to cynicism and maturity the reckless dream of those bygone days.

*But For Now We Are Young* features a unique narrative structure based around the Rider-Waite tarot, where each chapter corresponds to one of twenty-two major arcana. Playthroughs are ordered around a "shuffled" deck, where chapters proceed in a semi-random order designed to mirror the stochastic nature of memories, resulting in multiple potential narratives and interpretations, each intentionally incomplete.

## Features

* A realistic, grounded approach to coming-of-age stories, focused on capturing the texture and beauty of the mundane
* Twenty-two aesthetically distinct slice-of-life chapters, exploring a wide variety of emotions and topics
* A uniquely semirandom tarot-influenced narrative structure, resulting in multiple potential narratives and interpretations

## History

I started working on *But For Now We Are Young* some time during March of 2019, during a rather bleak period of my life. I'd been out of university for about a year at that point, was drifting through random entry-level jobs that had little to do with what I had studied in school (not that I wanted to do any work related to what I'd studied, which I hated anyways), and felt virtually no sense of purpose in life. I watched as my former friends from high school started graduating, started landing full-time positions at corporate firms and hedge funds and tech giants, making more in signing bonuses than I'll ever probably be worth in my life: and I felt not only profoundly worthless, but incapable of ever producing anything of worth. It wasn't just status anxiety, but a kind of pervasive existential anxiety (although I suppose in the world we live in, the two are fundamentally inextricable if not outright interchangeable). People who once looked up to me as someone worthy of asking for help or an opinion were now leagues beyond me, living completely different kinds of lives, actually contributing things to society, while I wasted away in my room.

Well, anyways, you probably knew all this already.

"What happened?" I kept on asking myself. "How did it get this way?" Of course, I knew the answer: I probably always did, all along. But up until that point, I'd refused introspection. I couldn't cope with what I imagined -- assumed -- to be the inevitable conclusions, which of course would have been further if not fatal affirmations of the profound ineptitude of my existence. Then, for whatever reason, something changed one day.

I can't remember what the impetus was, if there was any at all. But one afternoon, while sitting at my desk, I suddenly remembered what seemed like the funniest thing in the world. Senior year of high school, we had an anatomy teacher -- his name was Joel -- who was short, unabashedly bald, and who was otherwise pretty calm and mild-mannered but had a tendency to move suddenly in an uncharacteristically aggressive manner. One time, while we were dissecting cats, one of my friends called him over to examine something, and -- not wearing gloves, and with his bare hands -- Joel immediately thrusted his fingers into the chest cavity of the cat to examine the anomaly, pushing around bits of muscle and splintered bone and viscera. We were all pretty shocked at the time, but then as soon as he left, we burst into laughter which didn't seem to end until the next day. Later, someone placed the cat's intestinal tract, perfectly excised, into the basin of the water fountain which caused a minor custodial shutdown. 

It was unbearably stupid and irresponsible. But sitting in the darkness of my room that one afternoon, remembering all of that suddenly with such acute clarity -- the reek of formaldehyde, the sound of fingers slipping through cold flesh, the pain in my chest from laughing as long and hard as we did so that I felt like I couldn't stand up or even breathe -- I found myself laughing harder than I'd laughed in years, and soon after, I noticed that I was crying too: wave after cowardly wave. I can't tell you if it was out of joy, or sadness, or the sheer mechanical exertion of laughing so much. I spent the rest of the day going through old conversations, cutting open boxes of things I'd sealed away from old friendships, old relationships, mementos of people who now seem utterly foreign to me but were once so close I could look in their eyes without fear and feel their presences without shame. I could remember everything so distinctly, so clearly. Our futures seemed so plastic back then, viewed through the ironic amber of memory. My friends may have moved on, but I couldn't. Someone had to be left behind to tell the story of the things we did, the things we saw, the things we felt. I was always the best writer amongst us, anyways. It seemed like the right thing to do. It was in that moment that *But For Now We Are Young* came into existence. 

Progress was good at first. Within a week I had a fully functioning framework built, with impressive visuals to boot. It was the first game I'd worked on, let alone posted about publicly, in almost a year. People received it really positively online. In general, it felt good to be working on something again, something I really cared about this time. Something new, that was entirely my own.

The past is a fickle thing though, and hopelessly bound to the present.

When I turned twenty, at the peak of my despair, I made a resolution to kill myself at the age of twenty-two (why that age specifically, I can't remember anymore) if I couldn't produce anything of worth to the world by then. In the past, I was sixteen, the future seemed infinitely elastic and far away, and I was surrounded by my friends every day. In the present though, I was twenty-one, my future seemed dim, and everyone around me had moved on. However much I tried to remain in the light and warmth of my nostalgia, the reality of the present always seeped in. 

The thing people never really talk about with suicide is that it's one of those kinds of punctuation marks that has a tendency to fundamentally rewrite the shape of one's narrative towards its conclusion. Suicide is an act so intentional that the gravity it exerts inevitably and dramatically reshapes the context of one's life towards itself. The future of my past become hopelessly clouded by the future of my present; every interaction started looking like a hairline stress fracture culminating towards the epicentre of my imminent annihilation. What had started out as a celebration of my friends past and present and the things we carried together, slowly but surely became something far lonelier, far more selfish: a genealogy of my despair.

In June of 2019, only three months after the inception of the project, I decided to indefinitely suspend work on *But For Now We Are Young*. My reasons for this were twofold: first, I had long lost sight of my original intentions with the project and no longer felt I could suitably achieve what I had wanted from it in the first place; and second, largely inspired by the enthusiasm and encouragement of some new friends, because my attention had shifted to a new project (originally conceived of as a casual side project I'd work on to let off stress from *Young*), which you now know as *My Work Is Not Yet Done*. 

Although from a logistical perspective, progress on the project was advancing very well -- by the time I suspended it, I had over half the chapters, including the beginning and the end, fully developed -- the overall tone and message felt extremely bleak, to put it lightly; and despite being accurate in terms of the representation of certain feelings, the project overall still very much disproportionately focused on one particular aspect of my life which I feel is not fully representative of either my intentions with the project or even the time periods or relationships which they were supposed to represent. Lastly, I feel it would have been at best irresponsible and worst potentially dangerous to have released the work in such a state, both with regards to myself and my friends given my mental condition at the time, and to any players who might have been in a similar kind of mindset and who could have potentially read the overall message as an invocation to or affirmation of destructive behaviour. To put it more simply, I didn't want anyone to play my game and come away feeling more encouraged to kill themselves, and after a while I stopped wanting to work on something which basically by design encouraged me to think about killing myself as well.

To end on a positive note, I feel much better in general now about the past and the present alike, and although the future still holds no small degree of anxiety for me, I now feel like I'm prepared to at least face it head-on instead of retreating immediately into delusions of the past. I lived past my intended date of expiration and no longer harbour any significant thoughts about killing myself or others. This was made possible in large part, if not exclusively through, the efforts of my friends both old and new, who stood by me in my worst moments and made the continuous effort to cultivate the good in me in spite of the petty and the spiteful. Although for now my attention is dedicated exclusively to *My Work Is Not Yet Done*, which will be my first (hopefully successful...) major release, I definitely have plans to return to *But For Now We Are Young* in the future, once I feel stable enough to be able to tell these stories with the sincerity and honesty they deserve. How soon that future will be, I don't yet know; but I know for certain that one day, it'll arrive. 

But for now, we are young...

## Influences

*But For Now We Are Young* is a largely autofictional work. Nearly every location, product, event, and person referenced is directly analogous to some real-world equivalent, and the few that don't directly map to any actual counterparts are composites of real things and people. 

I'll speak more about the influences, homages and allusions behind each individual chapter closer to release, but for now,the overall aesthetic direction, especially for the UI, is heavily influenced by the design of early Macintosh systems, especially mid-90s designs such as Mac OS 3 (System 3.0). This decision was made less out of adherence to any particular feelings of nostalgia -- I don't think I've ever actually personally seen, let alone used, a Mac older than the 2012 MacBook Pro, to be honest -- and more because I wanted the overall presentation to be based around a geometrically coherent and clean UI experience while retaining the 1-bit style of most of my work, which I discovered the older Mac OSs to be perfect for in terms of providing a suitable base platform.

## About

Sutemi Productions is an independent digital collective based in the New York metropolitan area. It derives its name from *sutemi waza*, a term in various Japanese martial arts that can be roughly translated as “arts of abandonment”: a series of techniques requiring the user to “abandon”, or sacrifice some part of their stance in order to create or exploit an opening in the opponent. The fundamental philosophy underlying all of the works produced under Sutemi Productions is that only through directly confronting, without insincerity or resentment, our deepest flaws and vulnerabilities can we begin to produce works that are honest to the best versions of what they – and we – can be.
