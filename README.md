# docs
A repository containing all public-facing documents for my projects where applicable, including presskits and postmortems. Projects listed include active projects, suspended projects (ie, ones that are still in development but are no longer currently in active production for whatever reason) and terminated projects. These are identical to the ones in the source repositories for each respective project where available; the only difference is the public availability during the course of development. 

For a list of writing, please see ["WRITING.md"](https://github.com/spncryn/docs/blob/master/WRITING.md).

You can find a list of available releases below:
